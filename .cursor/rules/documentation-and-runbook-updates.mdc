For every new feature implementation, addition, or significant refactor:
- Always generate or update a corresponding Markdown documentation file under `/docs/features/` or the relevant subfolder.
- Each feature doc must include:
  - Summary (1–2 lines)
  - Purpose & scope
  - Key UI components used
  - Data flow (ViewModel → Model → Persistence)
  - Testing or QA considerations
  - Related tickets or links (if any)
- After implementing or modifying a feature, update the `Runbook.md` file to reflect:
  - New dependencies or modules
  - Build or configuration steps
  - Changes in environment variables or app setup
- Documentation should follow British English and use clear, concise technical writing.
- Keep the docs in sync with code; do not generate placeholder or boilerplate documentation.

If unsure where to add documentation, consult `/docs/Runbook.md` or `ios-cursor-context.md` for conventions.
