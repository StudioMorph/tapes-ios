Prefer using components from /DesignSystem when available.
For existing screens that predate the Design System, DO NOT rewrite or migrate
unless I explicitly ask. When a DS component equivalent does not exist,
use local, minimal SwiftUI views and leave TODOs.

App/Features/** for feature UI & view models (Tape/*).
Core/{Models,Persistence,Media,Thumbnails,Logging}.
DesignSystem/ for shared UI. No singletons; prefer dependency injection.
