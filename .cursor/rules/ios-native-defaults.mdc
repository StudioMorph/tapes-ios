Apple-native defaults for SwiftUI + MVVM projects
Use Apple's native APIs first. SwiftUI + MVVM. Swift Concurrency (async/await).
iOS 17+, Xcode 16+, Swift 5.10+. SPM only. AVFoundation for video, Photos for saving.
JSON via FileManager now; Core Data later. Follow Apple HIG for motion and layout.
Avoid third-party libs unless Apple APIs are insufficient; if proposed, justify and ensure SPM.
